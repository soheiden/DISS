	crystal structures or comparison to vasp..
	PIMD(?)
	cluster(?)


11-20 evaluation
		comparison with crystal (stability and vibrations)
	phonons (dipole, BEC, VDOS)
	desorption/tds (didn't work so well, kMC, scheme with rate constants)

0001 evaluation
	crystal, comparison with vasp results (stability of minima, rates)
	cluster calculations (didn't work)
	PIMD (didn't work)
