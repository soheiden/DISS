introduction

11-20 evaluation
	structures
	vibrations
		comparison with crystal (stability and vibrations)
	reaction paths
	phonons (dipole, BEC, VDOS)
	desorption/tds (didn't work so well, kMC, scheme with rate constants)

0001 evaluation
	trajectories for dissociation process
	crystal, comparison with vasp results (stability of minima, rates)
	cluster calculations (didn't work)
	PIMD (didn't work)
