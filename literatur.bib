        abstract  ={The ultra-high vacuum (UHV) room temperature adsorption of benzotriazole (BTAH){,} a well-known corrosion inhibitor for copper{,} has been investigated on the pristine Au(111) surface using a combination of surface sensitive techniques. The dimensionality of the molecule is reduced from the 3D crystal structure to a 2-dimensional surface confinement{,} which induces the formation of hydrogen bonded 1-dimensional molecular chains consisting of alternating pro-S and pro-R enantiomers mainly. The 0-dimensional system is characteristic of gas-phase BTAH{,} which undergoes a tautomeric equilibrium{,} with consequences for the resulting adsorbed species. The balance between hydrogen bonding{,} inter-chain van der Waals interactions and surface-molecule interactions{,} and the correlation with the dimensionality of the system{,} are discussed in light of the experimental results and a computational description of the observed features.}
